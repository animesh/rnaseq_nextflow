Using smallRNA adapter for trimming (count: 18). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 12)
Adapter sequence: 'TGGAATTCTCGG' (Illumina small RNA adapter; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Optional adapter 2 sequence (only used for read 2 of paired-end files): 'GATCGTCGGACT'
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 18 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Running FastQC with the following extra arguments: -t 6
Output file will be GZIP compressed
